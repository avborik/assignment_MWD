<h3 >Client Side</h3>
<p>On the client side, the web-site used HTML, CSS, JavaScript framework JQuery 1.8.3 . Also the web site used tools like: RSS, Google Analitics and some wigets on Twitter, Facebook and Twitch social network and servises</p>
<h3>Server side</h3>
<p>In the server side, the side used Apache and linux OS(Unfortunatelly, I did not find versions numbe, the site is very secured and all information hidden). Actually, web site running on many servers. All of them placed in diferent location to cover all world region.</p>
<p>Here is main servis details:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="technique_servers.PNG" width="969" height="399" alt=""/></div>
<p>Main server is placed at 100 CENTURYLINK DR Monroe LA 71203 USA. Owner and maintainer is Qwest Communications Company, LLC. The serves accept and use FTP and DAV protocols which let easily to update, upload and mangage web-sites. The .com domain(it is main domain) rented up to the year 2022. Also web-site use Vanish cache tools.</p>
<p>Unfortunatelly I found not a lot of infromation. The rockstargames hidded all infromation about servers ( I think it is in secure reason, because it is games web-site and many gamers need to use cheats, and this information will be useful for them. I emailed their support team about this information, but they did not answered me. Then I tried make tracert command to site and than get server information trough telnet connection, but it was also unsaccessfull, because all connection on telnet in ports 80 and 443 redirected to another hidden port and the disconected.</p>
