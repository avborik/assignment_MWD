<h2 class="textbk">Improvements and Design principles</h2>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>The main problem is, that the menu bar does not have home button. It is a serious problem, when visitor navigate the site. While using the site, I have clicked on back browser button more than 30 times. It will be not nessesary if home page will contain only welcome message or similiar content. But in this site, the pages contain highlight links to all news, newver information and play role of navigation map. My opinion is that sites should have home buttons. It is really help in navigation, specially if web-site has a lot of content. Navigation bar on the bottom part(support menu bar) is really overloaded. It has to many links and in my opinion, many of them are possible to group together.</p>
<h2>Topography</h2>
<p>The site used usual and interesting fonts and used appropriate style. But in some pages, fonts are really small, size is 9px. Paragraphs with these fonts have not much texts. And it is little bet harder to read it. especially for people who has problems with eyes. In some place. The fonts has not dark black fonts which placed on white color. It is also harder to read. All links are do not underlied as links and do not change to blue color after visit. This is also problem to understand where the links.</p>
<h2>Layout</h2>
<p>The layout of all pages is nearly the same. it are contain header body and footer parts. In the first view it are usual scheme in web design. But the body section is devided on some small parts. This technique used like highlight the some parts of content. But I think that it cause on body section. It looks like not one section, It are like five or six differnt parto of content in one pages. It cause on convinient reading of text. I think, more better way to delete menu bar in bottom part and make another page for this information or move it to support page. It is really looks like overloaded and take time to read and think where to go.</p>
<h2>Contrast</h2>
<p>Actually the web-site does not have any significant problem in contrast. But the problem in left and right part of web-site. In this part used JQuery wich change background pictures by time. When I was doing this report in september and start of october. This pictures contain worming adn easelly for eyes colors. But in the end of october, the new gave was realised. The game is Red dead desemption 2. As in game tittle, the web-site background pictures were change on static red background and it is not changing. This approach makes a serious problem with contrast. Background is red and Iframe is white. All these elements make the site so contrasted. The red color is not eyes frendly and may couse on comfortable reading for many people. This is not longer event, but in my opinion, it serious mistake which can couse an visitors activity, which was decrease in last month.</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>Usability on the site in nearly to perfect level. However, the developers missed mobile OS. The did not make step on future because Mobiles OS is the future technologes. It was developed less than ten years ago, but now more than 95% of users have devises wiht mobile OS. Futhermore, Mobile OS in nowadays have performance similiar and in some aspects better than desctop os. This is reason to make version for mobile os and many companies already have mobile version. But rockstargames took another way, just adopt desktop version. in my opinion it was not better step for user who used touch oriented devices and small displays. </p>
<h2>Menu layout</h2>
<p>Menu layouts in header and footer sections have some problems. The menu bar in header, in my opinion have unnessesary text, which alwayes change. It is  have not any usefull effect and only decrease load time. The text with cities, where placed the rockstargames studious anlso is unnessesary information. We can find it in history or about part. THis is not propriate place for all elements, excluded menu buttons. Footer part is so overloaded, it need to redues number of links or delete it and move to support page.</p>
<h2>Multimedia</h2>
<p>The web-site has intersting, professionally compliated multimedia ellements. But I think, their number is two small. Two biggest elements are just videoplayers and other for decoration. Web-site also did not have any ad banners on their production, for example in left and right part, which not used. It will be good way and can reduce number of page copies. Alos content will be more opened, alwayes in eyes catching places. Another disadvatage is that site use JQuery for multimedia elements. It is good way for develop elements. But a=unfortunatelly, not all browsers use it and some users block Jquery, because it can has malware. Sume people used old hardware. I think, good way to add flash element, it will couse on loadtime. but it will let other group of visitiors to comfortable use this site. It can seriously increase number of visits.</p>
<h2 class="textbk">Design principels</h2>
<p>When I created this web site, I have used three main principles, which I tried used as much as possible. This principles are:</p>
<h2>Balancing</h2>
<p>I tried to make many different layouts, which I found on internet. But the most intersting and useful for this assignment's requirements is: To try place most of the elements align in the centre. The left and part of web-site do not using, because it helpfull for mobile OS and for devices wiht low resolution. All text was aligh to the left. I leave this this version, because when looking on this web site, the eye naturally looks into the middle of the page and we do not need move around them. Left aligned text is the easiest to read, All books, pappers  used the same alighn and it comfortable for readers.</p>
<h2>Contrast</h2>
<p>In my site, I tried to use warm colors wich will be convienient for reading and frendly for eyes. After made some variants, I found that green color is so eyes friendly and it is good background for web-site. Anoter advantage that it is unique, I found not much web-site which use the same color scheme. For text, I got white color. It is become contrasted than black color, but it did not have negative effect for eyes. It looks like intersting, because usually most of sites used black fonts. But eyes have so fast adoption for this text. </p>
<h2>Navigation and Layout</h2>
<p>Actually they are different techniques, but the best way is to compose them together. For layout, I made the fast desision to use standart layout: Header, body and footer parts. This is standart layout and in my view it is usefull for compose lots of elements in center of page and make it eyes catching. For navigation i take horizontal style of meny bar. Wich is usefull for assignment requirements and looks habitually for visitors. </p>
